# Deep-Learning-Experiments
Few experiments done as I learn Deep Learning  

### Dog Classifier
This is an introductory project that I did to practice some basics of deep learning.  
The directory has three files:  
- [dog_or_cat.ipynb](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/main/dogclassifier/dog_or_cat.ipynb) shows how the data was collected and model trained.  
- [dog_or_not](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/tree/main/dogclassifier/dog_or_not) has the dog and cat dataset used.  
- [dogcat_trial](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/tree/main/dogclassifier/dogcat_trial) has the [model.pkl](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/main/dogclassifier/dogcat_trial/model.pkl) from [Jeremy's](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/saving-a-basic-fastai-model/data) model. I used this model as it is better as it has been trained on a larger dataset. Also, the folder has an [app.py](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/main/dogclassifier/dogcat_trial/app.py) that has been deployed at huggingface Gradio platform.  

The dog classifier app can be accessed at [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maureenmugo/projects).
