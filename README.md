# Deep-Learning-Experiments
Few experiments done as I learn Deep Learning  

### Dog Classifier
This is an introductory project that I did to practice some basics of deep learning.  
The directory has three files:  
- [dog_or_cat.ipynb](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/main/dogclassifier/dog_or_cat.ipynb) shows how the data was collected and model trained.  
- [dog_or_not](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/tree/main/dogclassifier/dog_or_not) has the dog and cat dataset used.  
- [dogcat_trial](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/tree/main/dogclassifier/dogcat_trial) has the [model.pkl](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/main/dogclassifier/dogcat_trial/model.pkl) from [Jeremy's](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/saving-a-basic-fastai-model/data) model. I used this model as it is better as it has been trained on a larger dataset. Also, the folder has an [app.py](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/main/dogclassifier/dogcat_trial/app.py) that has been deployed at huggingface Gradio platform.  

The dog classifier app can be accessed at [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maureenmugo/projects).  

### Bearlesson2  
This is an experiment I did for practice. It does a classification of three types of bears: grizzly, black and teddy bear.  
The bears.ipynb shows how the data was cleaned and model trained. It also shows how we can use the trained model as inference and create an app on the notebook that does the classification.  
The folders has others files:  
- [bears](https://github.com/maureen-mugo/Deep-Learning-Experiments/tree/main/bearlesson2/bears), the dataset used.
- three jpg files of the three different bears
- export.pkl, the trained model.  

### Optimazation
optimization.ipynb is a file that shows how a neural network works.
